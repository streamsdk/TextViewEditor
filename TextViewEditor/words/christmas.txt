Christmas is the gentlest, loveliest festival of the revolving year ¨C and yet, for all that, when it speaks, its voice has strong authority.
¡°May your Christmas¡¯ be filled with love, laughter, good food and fine wines.
-------------------
As long as we know in our hearts 
what Christmas ought to be, Christmas is.
-------------------
Christmas is a necessity. There has to be at least one day of the year to remind us that we're here for something else besides ourselves.
-------------------
Peace on earth will come to stay, when we live Christmas every day.
