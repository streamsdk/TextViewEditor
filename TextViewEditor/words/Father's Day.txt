Against all philosophies, sciences, counsels, logic, reasoning and self-motivation books, is that one smile from you that fills me with such energy as to make me feel like I can do everything possible and impossible. Happy Father's Day!
I am telling you a secret today but you have to promise you won't tell mom about it. Promise? Okay! I love you more than mom. I always did.
If there is one complaint I want to make with God is that He didn't give me enough big words to talk about you and express my love for you :) Happy Father's Day!
The best thing that God has ever blessed [ me / us ] with is a wonderful and caring dad like you. Happy Father's Day
Every time I reflect on one of my life's accomplishments, I can't help but realize that I achieved it because of something you taught me. Happy Father's Day!
I never understood why you did some of the things you did when I was younger. Now it all makes sense. Thanks Dad and I love you.
